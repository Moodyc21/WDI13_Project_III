# WDI13_Project_III

## Intro

- 'Welcome to Scratch! The app that keeps track of your golf strokes. Clicking the golf ball on your phone adds a stroke every time you hit the ball so it is easy to remember your score at the end of every hole without having to run to your cart to scratch you strokes on paper. Scratch updates your strokes to a digital scorecard and tallies up your total at the end of the front nine, back nine and then totaled to together at the end of 18. Scratch is a convienent way to keep track of your game while you try to become a Scratch golfer!'

## Technologies 

-> Styled-Components
-> React-Data-Table
-> JQuery
-> Heroku
-> Create-react-app
-> MongoDB

## Approach 

-> My approach was to come up with a design that was simple and straighforward. Something anyone could pick up and use and not even need instructions. Intuitive. The user creates his/her profile, selects or inputs a course and then starts counting his strokes. I wanted it to be mobile first and responsive/adaptive. Obviously, I did not think anyone would be golfing with their laptop handy. I wanted the scorecard to be dynamic and updatable. 

## Unsolved-Problems

-> Editing/Deleting individual strokes on scorecard
-> Pulling golf course api to populate real golf-courses
-> Building out visual scorecard
-> Building courses view
-> Having a single dynamic Holes view for all holes
-> Full CRUD for Holes

## Notes-To-Self

-> Ask for more help. Ask more questions. Keep going.
